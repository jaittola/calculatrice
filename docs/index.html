  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    Calccis is a simple reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator app
    for iOS. It supports basic arithmetic, trigonometrical, logarithm
    and exponent calculations. Degrees and radians can be used
    for trigonometrical functions. Starting from version 1.0.2, Calccis
    supports calculations with complex numbers, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Calccis uses the usual double-precision numbers for calculations,
    which makes small inaccuracies in calculation results quite common
    (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3).
  </p>

  <p>
    Calccis does not copy or mimic any existing physical
    calculators. However, the operation of the stack has been
    influenced by how the stack works in the 1990s Hewlett-Packard
    HP-48 family of calculators.
