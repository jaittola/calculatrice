  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    Calccis is a simple reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator app
    for iOS. It supports basic arithmetic, trigonometrical, logarithm
    and exponent calculations. Both degrees and radians can be used
    for trigonometrical functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Calccis does not copy or mimic any existing physical
    calculators. However, the operation of the stack has been
    influenced by how the stack works in the 1990s Hewlett-Packard
    HP-48 family of calculators.
